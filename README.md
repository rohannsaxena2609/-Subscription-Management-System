# -Subscription-Management-System
The Subscription Management System is a C++ console-based application designed to manage user subscriptions effectively. It allows businesses or service providers to track and manage subscriber information, including subscription type, fees, and duration.


Subscription Management System â€“ Project Overview
The Subscription Management System is a C++ console-based application developed to efficiently manage user subscriptions for businesses or service providers. It provides a systematic way to handle subscriber details, including subscription type, fees, and duration, making it easier for organizations to track and manage their clients. The project leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, ensuring a modular and scalable design.

The system allows users to perform various operations such as adding new subscribers, searching for existing subscribers by email, filtering subscribers based on their subscription type, and removing subscribers when needed. The application provides a user-friendly, menu-driven interface that makes it easy for users to interact with the system.
